# MinimapPlugin

Just a small Minimap Plugin I made, it doesn't work great and the code is pretty messy, but I'm happy with it for now.

# Features:
Upon joining the server, you'll be given a map centered around your location, if you drop it then it'll be deleted, just do /map to get a new one. You won't be given a map if you already have one in your inventory. Left click with the map in your hand to recenter it around yourself, aside from that, there's not much else to this plugin.

# Commands:

Do /map to get a map
